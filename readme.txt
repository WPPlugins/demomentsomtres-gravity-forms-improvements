Some improvements to Gravity Forms plugin

== Description ==

We use Gravity Forms to implement all forms in the websites we built and manage.

Althought the Forms plugin is almost perfect, sometimes we need to improve it.

In order to offer our work to everybody, we decided to built this plugin.

= Features =

* Enable field label visibility settings using the filter gform_enable_field_label_visibility_settings.
* Inline DatePicker to show date picker as an inline calendar. Development based on the works of [Patrick Porto](https://github.com/patrickporto/gravityforms-datepickerinline) and the post at (http://wpsmith.net/2011/how-to-create-a-custom-form-field-in-gravity-forms-with-a-terms-of-service-form-field-example/)

== Installation ==

This tools plugin can be installed as any other WordPress plugin. 

It requires Gravity Forms, however, if you install it alone, it won't work but nothing will be broken ;)

No configuration required.
